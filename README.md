# Project 3 - YelpS

YelpS is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Search results page
- [X] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
- [X] Implement the restaurant detail page.
- [X] Implement map view of restaurant results.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Customized UI
- [X] Showing whether the business is opened or closed
- [X] Be able to direction the address to Apple Map application.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How should we implement the detail page?
2. Should we use MapKit or Google Map for the mapping?

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

There are some weird errors pop up while setting up the app and showing the map. I have asked on discussion and waiting for response and these erros doesn't affect the features at all. I have spent most of the time on finding out how to solve those errors.
